You need to sum all the numbers and return the list with all the numbers multiplied by the sum but leave 0s as 0s.  [-84, 51, -14, 80, 68, -67, 12]  Assistant: To complete this task, I will follow these steps:  Step 1: Identify the given list of integers. The list of integers given to us is [-84, 51, -14, 80, 68, -67, 12].  Step 2: Calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list. To find the sum of all the numbers in the list, we need to add all the integers together.  -84 + 51 + (-14) + 80 + 68 + (-67) + 12 = 46.  Step 3: Multiply each number (except 0s) in the list by the sum and create a new list with the updated values. For this given list, we will multiply each number by the sum, which is 46.  [-84 * 46, 51 * 46, -14 * 46, 80 * 46, 68 * 46, -67 * 46, 12 * 46]  Step 4: Calculate the values for the new list. [-3864, 2346, -644, 3680, 3128, -3082, 552]  Step 5: Return the updated list as the final result. The updated list with all the numbers multiplied by the sum (except 0s) is [-3864, 2346, -644, 3680, 3128, -3082, 552].You are given a sentence in Arabic.

It is said that the origin of Judaism followers in Laos was due to the attraction to flee from persecution in countries such as South Vietnam. The Kachin people were the first to compress as Israeli Tourism has continually committed to building their footprint in Laos. In 2012, tourism numbers swelled, while cultural exchanges and conferences have become commonplace. Laos's cuisine has revealed some of the Jewish cuisine traditions, which connect people from around the world with some of the foods eaten by the ancestors.

In rural areas, or places with developed infrastructure and regular fire service, wildfires typically occur when a spark or small fire initiated by humans gets out of control, often because of a lack of proper precautions. A few common sources of human-caused ignition are discarded cigarettes, careless campers, and fireworks. In undeveloped areas with combustible vegetation wildfires can also be caused by lightning. A natural spark in an area with dry vegetation can cause a wildfire. The rain and abundance of water in the air when lightning occurs during a storm can douse and prevent a fire before it becomes a catastrophic wildfire. Wildfires are more frequent and more severe when there are long periods of drought and founding temperatures. Wildfires are also more frequent and more severe when there has been a buildup of flammable vegetation due to a history of suppressing smaller and less severe fires.  I am facing a new situation today: John was interested in the solar system and space in general. To that end, he invited two of his friends, Eric and Mark, to his place to discuss more about the solar system. All of them had basic knowledge about the solar system.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which friend would be more likely to cite human factors of wildfires, Eric or Mark? A:  Assistant: Based on the information provided in the background article, Eric and Mark both have basic knowledge about the solar system. Therefore, we cannot assume that one of them has more knowledge about human factors of wildfires than the other. However, considering the article mentioned that wildfires can be caused by various human factors such as discarded cigarettes, careless campers, and fireworks, it is likely that both Eric and Mark have at least some awareness of human factors contributing to wildfires. Thus, without more specific information about their knowledge levels on the subject, neither Eric nor Mark can be specifically labeled as more likely to cite human factors of wildfires.
